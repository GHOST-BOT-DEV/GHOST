# Terms of Service
 - ### **Last Updated: 3/12/25**
 - The creator of the bot has every right to blacklist you from using it at any moment. By using any of the bot's commands you automatically agree to these terms and the privacy policy. If you break these terms, the owner of the bot can and will blacklist you from using the bot, to keep the community using this bot as non-toxic as possible.
 - The biggest rule about using this bot is no slurs and no threats. Saying either of those things will result in a blacklist (even an automatic one if the filter catches you) so I advise you to not do that.
 - Using alts to evade blacklists is prohibited. As stated in the **Privacy Policy** below, every message is logged and most likely will be manually checked by the developers.
 - Appeals to blacklists are possible but only to innocent users. You can only be re-whitelisted if the bot falsely flagged your message as being against the rules. If that does happen, go to the [**Support Server**](https://discord.gg/FFR6d2uF76) and make a ticket.
 - Along with that, do NOT falsely accuse people of big allegations like being a p*dophile. If it is found that you are lying about those accusations, you WILL be blacklisted.

# Privacy Policy
 - ### **Last Updated: 3/12/25**
 - Every message sent using the bot is logged and is manually reviewed for moderation purposes. The logs only show the data of the message, no personal data is collected.
 - Again, the owner can review all of the logs and ban you at any time. By using and/or adding the bot, you agree to this policy.
 - If you wish to opt-out of giving your message info to the bot, find another bot. This bot will always log messages, no negotiation.
